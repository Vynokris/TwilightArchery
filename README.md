The goal was to make a **Third Person Shooter**, with gameplay inspired by **Monster Hunter** and split screen local multiplayer on **Nintendo Switch**.
<br>

## **Gameplay**
In **Twilight Archery** the two players must kill a large and very dangerous robotic monster that is threatening the simulation they live in: the **CTHULHUBOT-MK120**. <br>
Players have to fight this threat with bow and arrows.<br>
The robot has many dreadful attacks that all involve shooting projectiles at the players. It does have weaknesses though:
- 4 weakpoints on his arms
- 1 weakpoint on his eye
